### EmptyWindow is a Gtk4/libadwaita window

A simple demo, nothing more.

I’d like to understand how to create an Adwaita‑styled window entirely in C without using any helper tools such as Cambalache. 

![window](preview-img1.png?raw=true) 

What for? Now I’m currently interested in how applications are built and how the code works. I study source code, try to understand it, experiment with different approaches, and learn from the experience I gain along the way.  
  
Personally, I work with the GNOME desktop environment and I like the Adwaita design, which is why I chose it.  
  


### Please note:
This code is part of my learning project and is for demonstration purposes only.
